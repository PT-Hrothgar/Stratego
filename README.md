# Stratego

This is the source code for my Stratego Python program. It is a simulation of the board game [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego) for two players to play in pass-and-play style.

I don't think versions 1.10 and earlier exist anywhere, but versions 1.11-1.13 are available here. Version 2.0 is in development, and I will upload it here when it is complete.
